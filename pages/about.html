      The Intercollegiate Center for Classical Studies in Rome (ICCS) was established in 1965 by representatives of ten American colleges and universities; the number of member institutions has now grown to over 100. It provides undergraduate students with an opportunity in Rome to study ancient history, archaeology, Greek and Latin literature, Italian language, and ancient art. <br><button id="readMoreButton">Read More</button><span id="readMore">ICCS has received generous aid from the Danforth Foundation, The Old Dominion Foundation, The Mellon Foundation, and the David and Lucille Packard Foundation, as well as the continuing support of a consortium of colleges and universities, and contributions from former students.

      A Managing Committee elected by the consortium colleges and universities determines the curriculum and selects the faculty, students, and scholarship recipients. The Managing Committee has arranged for administration of the Intercollegiate Center to be handled by Duke University's Global Education Office for Undergraduates.</span>

              <br> received her B.A. and M.A. in Classics from The Johns Hopkins University. Her own experience as a student at the ICCS not only encouraged her to pursue graduate work in classical art and archaeology, but has also significantly influenced her interests and research. Her master’s thesis, entitled “The Nature of the Cults at Poseidonia,” focused on the development of the cults of Hera and Aphrodite in the south Italian colony. She also holds an M.A. in Classical Art and Archaeology from Princeton University, where she is finishing her Ph.D. Her dissertation considers cultural memory and collective identity as reflected through the material culture of Classical and Hellenistic Sicily. While her academic interests focus broadly on Greeks in the West, methodologically, she is also interested in computer applications in archaeology and the digital curation of field data and archival records. Leigh's archaeological background stretches from the field to the museum. She served as an assistant curator for ancient arts at The Johns Hopkins University Archaeological Collection, a Hall Fellow in Ancient Art at the Walters Art Museum, and an ancient art intern at the Princeton University Art Museum. Leigh has excavated with the Università degli Studi di Napoli, “L’Orientale,” at Cuma, Italy, and with the American School of Classical Studies at Corinth, Greece. Since 2008, she has served as the Manager of Data and Information Resources for the Pompeii Archaeological Research Project: Porta Stabia. In 2013, she joined the American Excavations of Morgantina: Contrada Agnese Project as the Data Supervisor. In 2011/12, she studied as a regular member at the American School of Classical Studies in Athens. She also held the Oscar Broneer Traveling Fellowship at the American Academy in Rome during 2013/2014. Leigh is eager revisit the monuments and history of Rome and its surroundings with Centro students this year.

              <br> is a PhD candidate at the University of Pennsylvania in the Department of Classical Studies. She received her BA in History and Classics from Stanford University in 2010. Her dissertation explores the reception of Greek tragic models in Roman Augustan and imperial epic, focusing primarily on epic authors’ use of tragic models to reflect on issues of succession, paternity, and affiliation, both dynastic and literary. Her research interests are in Latin epic, fifth-century Athenian tragedy, women and gender, intertextuality, and the interactions between literature and culture in Augustan and Flavian Rome. At the University of Pennsylvania, Alice has taught undergraduate courses in Latin and Ancient Greek, has assisted in ancient Greek and Roman history courses, and served as a Graduate Fellow for Teaching Excellence with the Center for Teaching and Learning for 2014-15. She has also spent a season at the Gabii Project field school near Rome. She looks forward to running and tasting her way through Italy, and is excited to explore Rome, both ancient and modern, with Centro students.
