<section id="info">
Each year there are Fall and Spring semester terms. Every student must take the Ancient City course, which is an intensive introduction to ancient material culture. The Ancient City, with its extensive travel component, has been honed and perfected through fifty years of experience, and our faculty is assembled each year around a seasoned scholar brought in to teach it as the Andrew W. Mellon Professor in Charge.

<br><br>

You will normally sign up for two additional courses on top of the double-credit Ancient City. These are usually Ancient Greek or Latin, which are offered both at the intermediate and advanced levels. You might, however, opt for either Beginning Italian or Renaissance and Baroque Art History instead of one of the ancient languages, and we’re OK with that. Some sign up for 5 courses, though we don’t encourage that.

<br><br>

Official transcripts for credits pursued at the ICCS are issued by Duke University. It is your responsibility to secure approval for transfer of these credits to your home institution--talk to your advisor.

<br><br>

We also have important academic connections with the American Academy in Rome, including a Research Experience for Undergraduates working in the Academy’s Study Collection. Students admitted to the program work with real objects in the Academy’s collection and assist in curating an exhibition or equivalent event at the semester’s end.

The ICCS program is the gold standard. We’ve been an integral part of the undergraduate preparation of a huge number of Professors, Museum Directors and Curators, and High School Latin teachers.

It would be wrong however, to think that we are only for the graduate-school bound. The vast majority of Centristi over fifty years have gone on to fields unrelated to Classics: finance, business, medicine, law, film, writing, and many other professions.

The ICCS is a rigorous program and we take our academics very seriously, but time has shown that such academic rigor serves all of our students. If you’re looking for a low-intensity ‘vacation’ study abroad experience, the Centro probably isn’t for you. But if you are a serious student of classics, we can help propel you into your chosen career with a distinctive experience and continued support. It is normal for Centro professors to get to know their students better than those at their home institution, and for Centristi to receive support in the form of advice and letters of recommendation years after they have returned from Rome.
